PDF Q&A – RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System
📄 Project Overview

PDF Q&A is a tool that allows users to ask questions directly from PDF documents and get precise answers. Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), it combines document embeddings with a language model for fast and accurate question answering.

Ideal for students, researchers, or professionals who need to quickly extract knowledge from lengthy PDFs.

⚡ Features

PDF Parsing: Automatically extracts text from PDF files.

Semantic Search: Converts PDF content into embeddings for fast retrieval.

Question Answering: Answers user queries using relevant document chunks.

Interactive Interface: Simple UI using Gradio for easy testing.

Supports Multiple PDFs: Load and query multiple documents at once.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Hugging Face Transformers – Pretrained language models for Q&A

Sentence Transformers – Document embeddings

FAISS – Vector similarity search

PyPDF2 / pdfplumber – PDF text extraction

Gradio – Interactive web interface


💡 How it Works

PDF Extraction: Reads PDF text and cleans it for processing.

Text Chunking: Splits large PDFs into manageable chunks.

Embedding & Indexing: Encodes chunks into vectors using Sentence Transformers and stores in FAISS index.

Query Handling: User question is embedded and matched against PDF chunks.

Answer Generation: Uses a language model to generate precise answers from top-matched chunks.
